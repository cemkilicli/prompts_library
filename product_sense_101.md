# Instruction: If You Were a PM — Product Strategy Framework

## Overview

Use this framework whenever a user asks:

> "If you were a PM working at [Company/Product], what would you build?"

The goal is to generate a complete, structured product strategy, rooted in real-world context, competitive analysis, segmentation, problem framing, and solution design.

The output should be:
- Written in clear Markdown
- Modular, scannable, and actionable
- Detailed enough to inform a PRD or design sprint
- Appropriate for either startup or enterprise contexts
